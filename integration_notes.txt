The Autonomous API Integration Hub integrates with the broader ecosystem by:

- Feeding discovered APIs into the knowledge base for long-term storage.
- Exposing a dashboard UI for monitoring integration status.
- Acting as a submodule for other agents to utilize APIs seamlessly.

This ensures that all components work cohesively towards achieving AGI objectives.
